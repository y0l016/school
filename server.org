Introduction: 

This Investigatory project – The ChatServer is being presented in the form of literate programming. Literate programming is a programming paradigm in which the code is being explained in a way that we the humans could easily understand rather interpreting like a computer. We are meant to read, and so we’ve opted for literate programming so that one can easily understand the code when referring it in the future. This document can be tangled down into the program.  

This entire project is made using free and/or open-source software such as Emacs, CPython, Vim, etc. and licensed under BSD 2 Clause “Simplified” License. 

 

Concordat: 

When beginning this project, we wanted the message data to be simple, elegant and portable. And so, the concordat was framed with reference to these aspects in mind. In order to comply with maximum portability, we’ve opted to use JSON, JavaScript Object Notation which is supported by most programming languages for the data struct part. 

The data structure of the message is composed of two key:value pairs. The keys to be named as `nick` and msg.
